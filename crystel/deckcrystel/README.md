Create a new deck with 'deck = Deck.new'
each Deck has two attributes, position, and groups.
You can deal, 
  deck.deal(number_of_cards_in_each_hand, number_of_hands)
You can deal_in,
You can use 'group_no' to move cards from one group to the next:
  deck.group_no(group_number, number_of_cards_off_the_top, group_to_move_them_to, where_in_that_group)
