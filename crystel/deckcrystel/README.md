Create a new deck with 'deck = Deck.new' 
Each Deck has two attributes: position, and groups. 
You can deal, deck.deal(number_of_cards_in_each_hand, number_of_hands) 
You can deal_in, 
You can use 'group_no' to move cards from one group to the next: deck.group_no(group_number, number_of_cards_off_the_top, group_to_move_them_to, where_in_that_group) 
You can also use EukerDeck and ExplodingDeck for Euker and Exploding Kittens.
New in 1.1.1: CribDeck with modified dealing method!
Don't forget that ExplodingDeck and CrubDeck have a different way of calling their dealing method: deck.deal(number_of_hands)
