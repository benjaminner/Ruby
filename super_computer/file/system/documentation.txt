Documentation for super_computer.rb freedom (3.4.2)

New in scos freedom:

3.0:
-Ladies and gents, it's finally here. ALIASES!
Now you can use these to make super_computer feel more like bash by adding in your own commands!
This is the only major new feature in this major release, but it's a big one.
*IMPORTANT* Please, as soon as you get the new update, run the commands 'system delete aliases' to clear the experimental aliases you may have tinkered with.
Documentation for aliases are down below.
3.1:
-Added 'date format' to the system CommandClass (see below for description).
3.2:
-The 'help' command prints the documentation to screen after prompting.
3.3:
-Added new command: 'system delete alias', which you put the name of the alias you want to delete after (see below for description).
3.4:
-Added file:edit 'replace'. You use it by listing a line number and string after, and the given line will be replaced by that string.
-Added file:edit 'insert'. You use it by, like 'replace', listing a line number and string after. The line after the given line will become the given string. Everything else will
be pushed down a row.

Bugfixes in scos freedom:

-Bugfix 3.0.2.1: Creating new aliases would cause a crash if done after deleting aliases.
-Bugfix 3.0.3.1: Trying to create a directory that already exists causes a crash.
-Bugfix 3.0.3.2: Trying to create a file that already exists causes a crash.
-Bugfix 3.1.0.1: When the alias.txt file was missing in /file/system, it would try to recreate prompt.txt, then append text to a nonexistent file, causing a crash.
-Bugfix 3.2.0.1: When updating and creating the file folder at the same time (usually the first installation) the files would be updated and created in the wrong order,
which caused some files to be missing.
-Bugfix 3.3.0.1: Deleting all aliases would set the 'aliases' variable to an empty array, instead of an empty hash.
-Bugfix 3.3.0.2: After creating an alias that already existed, it would update in alias.txt as normal, but when you asked for the list of aliases it included both the old one and
the new one. Restarting super_computer fixed the issue.
-Bugfix 3.4.1.1: The documentation wouldn't update because it was trying to stick it in a file called 'documentation.rb', which didn't exist.
-Bugfix 3.4.1.2: Trying to run an fxg program would cause a crash because I was trying to load a file from a path that only existed on my computer. I didn't notice this before,
because it worked fine on my computer, but running it on my mom's computer caused a crash.
-Bugfix 3.4.2.1: The documentation and fxg files wouldn't update because of a bug in the self-updating part of the code.

Commands:

Instead of commands, super_computer has CommandClasses. Currently, there are 3, file, dir, and system.
To make a command, type the name of the CommandClass and then what you want to do.
The list of commands are below next to their unix counterpart or description. All caps signifies a variable of the given type.
